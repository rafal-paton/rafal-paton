### 👨‍💻 About Me  

Java developer focused on backend development and building clean, well-structured web applications. I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood and designing solutions that are maintainable, efficient, and scalable.

Before fully transitioning into software development, I spent nearly 10 years in the technology sector working on complex international automation projects for leading automotive brands. This background strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving approach, and ability to work effectively in multidisciplinary teams — skills I now apply daily in software engineering.

Currently focused on:
	•	Java & Spring ecosystem (Boot, Data, Security, WebFlux)
	•	RESTful APIs and backend architecture
	•	Clean code, testing, and best practices

Always eager to learn, improve, and contribute to meaningful, well-designed software.

Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out for collaboration!
